We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints and formats correctly.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -e .` and `pip install ruff pytest`.
3. Run tests: `pytest`.
4. Run linter: `ruff check .`
5. Run formatter: `ruff format .`
